aka: **"You don't need React to build reactive applications".**

## Concept Overview

They are many ways to build **reactive** web interfaces but do we really need to add the complexity of JavaScript frameworks like [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) or [React](https://reactjs.org/)?

These tools are very powerful but the complexity they add to a full-stack developer's workflow is **INSANE**.

This application shows how to build invoices application with reactive interface **without a line of JavaScript**.

Some features:

- Not a single full page reload
- Insane performance
- Really simple code to maintain
- Reactive dashboards and filters
- Background exports with real time updates in UI with WebSockets

## Resources

More and more developers come back from building dedicated SPAs and just want to use the power of Vue or React in a classic Backend application.

Many projects help you in multiples frameworks:
- [Hotwire](https://hotwire.dev/)
- [Laravel Livewire](https://laravel-livewire.com/)
- [Inertiajs](https://inertiajs.com/)
- [Stimulus Reflex](https://docs.stimulusreflex.com/)
- [Phoenix Live_View](https://github.com/phoenixframework/phoenix_live_view)
- [Django Unicorn](https://www.django-unicorn.com/)

If you're still perplex about this old school approach, you should watch this video from Sam Stephenson:
